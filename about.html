        <h4><strong style="color: black;">About Me:</strong></h4> As a final year IT student, I’m on a mission to blend creativity with code. From the moment I wrote my first “Hello, World!” program, I knew I was destined for the world of software engineering. But it’s not just about lines of code; it’s about shaping the future through innovation.

        Passion for Software Engineering: 🚀 I’ve spent countless late nights debugging, optimizing, and building software solutions. Whether it’s a sleek web app or a robust backend system, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. 🌐 My toolbox includes Python and C# . I’ve dabbled in frameworks like tkinter ,flask, and I’m always hungry to learn more.
        
        AI Enthusiast: 🤖 Artificial intelligence fascinates me. The idea of machines learning, adapting, and making decisions—it’s like magic! I’ve explored neural networks, natural language processing, and computer vision. 🔍 My final year project? An AI-powered recommendation system that suggests personalized playlists based on mood and musical taste. 🎵
        
        Academic Journey: 🎓 Pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in IT at DUT. 📚 Currently diving into machine learning algorithms and data science. 🔬 Exploring AI ethics and responsible AI practices
        Beyond the Screen: 🌟 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:

✈️ Dreaming of flying drones with AI navigation.
📚 Reading sci-fi novels (because AI and dystopian futures go hand in hand).
🎮 Playing strategy games (because optimizing algorithms is my jam).
Future Goals: 🌠 I envision a career where I bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and real-world impact. Whether it’s revolutionizing healthcare with AI diagnostics or creating sustainable solutions, count me in!

Remember, life is a debuggable journey, and I’m ready to tackle every challenge that comes my way. Let’s connect and build something amazing!
